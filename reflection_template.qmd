[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an A-.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

**WD-1: I can import data from a *variety* of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).**

-   `csv`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv
## This line of code came from Lab 2 Question 1
surveys <- read_csv(file = here::here("data", 
                                      "surveys.csv"), 
                    show_col_types = FALSE)
```

-   `xlsx`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx
## This line of code came from Practice Activity 4 Question 3
military <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"),

                             "xxx")
                      )
```

## Reproducibility

**R-1: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the here package.**

I've done this in the following provided assignments: Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3, Lab 4, and Lab 5, as well as the respective challenges for those assignments

**R-2: I can write well documented and tidy code.**

## Program Efficiency

**PE-1: I can write concise code which does not repeat itself.**

-   using a single function call with multiple inputs (rather than multiple function calls)

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-one-call
## This code comes from Lab 3 Question 12
teacher_evals_clean |> 
  filter(sex == "female",
         academic_degree %in% c("dr", "ma")) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(mean_resp = mean(resp_share)) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_resp)) |>
  slice(c(1, n()))
```

-   `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-across
## This code comes from Lab 3 Question 6
teacher_evals_clean |> 
  summarise(across(.cols = course_id:teacher_id,
                   .fns = ~ n_distinct(.x)))
```

-   `map()` functions

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-map-1
## This code comes Lab 9 Question 1
set.seed(5102005)
randomBabies <- function(nBabies){
  original_babies <- 1:nBabies
  new_babies <- sample(nBabies)
  correct_babies <- sum(original_babies == new_babies)
  return(correct_babies)
}

results <- map_int(.x = 1:10000,
                   .f = ~randomBabies(4)
                   )
```

**PE-2: I can write functions to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   Function that operates on vectors

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-1
## This code comes from Lab 7 Question 3
rescale_01 <- function(input_vec) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(input_vec), 
            length(input_vec) > 1)
  
  range_vec <- range(input_vec, na.rm = TRUE)
  min_value <- range_vec[1]
  max_value <- range_vec[2]
  
  if (min_value == max_value) {     
    return(rep(NA,
               length(input_vec)))  
  }     
    rescale_vec <- (input_vec - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
  return(rescale_vec)
}
```

-   Function that operates on data frames

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-2
## This code comes from Lab 7 Question 8
rescale_column <- function(sample_df, variable_vec) {
  stopifnot(is.data.frame(sample_df))
  sample_df <- sample_df |>
    mutate(across(.cols = variable_vec,
                .fns = ~rescale_01(.)))
  return(sample_df)
}
```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-across
## This code comes from Lab 7 Question 8
rescale_column <- function(sample_df, variable_vec) {
  stopifnot(is.data.frame(sample_df))
  sample_df <- sample_df |>
    mutate(across(.cols = variable_vec,
                .fns = ~rescale_01(.)))
  return(sample_df)
}
```

-   `map()` function with **one** input (e.g., `map()`, `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, etc.)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-1
## This code comes from Lab 8 Question 1
surveys |>
  map_chr(class) |>
  bind_rows() |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling()
```

-   `map()` function with **more than one** input (e.g., `map_2()` or `pmap()`)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-2
## This code comes from Lab 9 Question 6, which I attempted after the due date as it was optional
all_simulations <- grid |> 
  mutate(
    simulated_means = pmap(
      .l = list(
        n = n,
        df = df), 
      .f = simulate_means)
    ) |> 
  unnest(simulated_means) 
```

**PE-4: I can use modern tools when carrying out my analysis.**

-   I can use functions which are not superseded or deprecated

```{r}
#| label: pe-4-1
## This code comes from Lab 3 Question 7. The function if_any is not superseded by any other functions, but the function across was
teacher_evals_clean |> 
  filter(
    if_any(.cols = course_id:sex,
           .fns = ~ is.na(.x)
    )
  )
```

-   I can connect a data wrangling pipeline into a `ggplot()`

```{r}

## Data Simulation & Statisical Models

**DSSM-1: I can simulate data from a *variety* of probability models.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dsm-1-1
## This code comes from Lab 9 Question 4, which I attempted after the due date as it was optional
simulate_means <- function(n, df) {
  map_dbl(.x = 1:n, 
          .f = ~rchisq(n = 100,
                       df = df) |>
            mean()
          )
}
```

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dsm-1-2
## This code comes from Lab 9 Question 1
randomBabies <- function(nBabies){
  original_babies <- 1:nBabies
  new_babies <- sample(nBabies)
  correct_babies <- sum(original_babies == new_babies)
  return(correct_babies)
}

results <- map_int(.x = 1:10000,
                   .f = ~randomBabies(4)
                   )
```

**DSSM-2: I can conduct common statistical analyses in R.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dsm-2-1
## This code comes from Lab 4 Question 8 and the analysis comes from Lab 4 Question 10
reg_mod1 <- lm(mc_infant ~ mhi_2018, data = ca_childcare)
summary(reg_mod1)
```
The p-value that we obtained from this test was 2.2e-16, which is extremely small and is less than the 0.05 significance level. Thus, this gives us extremely strong evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between median household income and median weekly cost of center based childcare for children in California. From this, we can conclude that there does appear to be a relationship between these two variables. 

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dsm-2-2
## This code comes from Lab 2 Question 17 and the analysis comes from Lab 2 Question 18
species_mod <- aov(weight ~ species, data = surveys)

summary(species_mod)
```
The null hypothesis of this ANOVA test is that there is no significant difference between the weights of species, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference between the weights of different species. Based on our p-value from the ANOVA F-test, which is 2e-16, which is a very small p-value, we have strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the population mean weight is the same across all 14 rodent species, and thus we can reject the null. Thus we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the weights of the different species of rodents.

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I have submitted revisions for Lab 2, Lab 3, and I am currently working on the revisions for Lab 4 and Lab 5. I have left reflections on these assignments on what I did wrong and what I learned from it and how to fix them with the feedback that I received. On these revisions, my main goal was to learn and make improvements to my code, even if they were only small ones, so that I kept growing as a coder.

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

For Lab 3, on Question 8, I got a comment stating, "**Careful! You just found that there were 297 distinct teachers included in this data. So why are your counts over 2000?"** I went back to my code and attempted to fix this issue, writing in the revision reflection comment, saying **"Question 8: The mistake that I made originally was that I managed to get the demographics of the instructors, but I did not group them by the individual teacher id's, so I had repeated counts in each category. To fix this, instead of making a new column with the general counts, I changed it to be a column that counted the distinct teacher id's, so that there would be no repeats in the counting."**

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I've made an effort to extend my thinking on the assignments given in this course. An example of this is the Challenge for Lab 2, where I was able to create a ridge plot to satisfy the Medium level.

```{r}
#| label: extending-my-thinking
## This code comes from Challenge 2 Medium
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(
         x = weight, 
         y = species, 
         group = species)) + 
  geom_jitter(color = "steelblue", 
              alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_density_ridges(fill = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Density Plots of Species of Rodent by Their Weight", 
       x = "Weight (g)", 
       y = NULL, 
       subtitle = "Rodent Species") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45),
        axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 45))
```

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

![](images/Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 8.27.30 PM-01.png)

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

During the weekly practice activities, I believe that I grew as a collaborator through having to work with a partner in the roles of coder and developer. These exercises often challenged me to be an effective communicator with my partner, as well as understand their point of view when it came to using a specific type of workflow for a question as opposed to another way. Changing roles also challenged me to be able to verbalize my ideas and it made me more patient when it was my partner's turn to do the same, as I knew how hard it was to do such a thing as verbalize the ideas that were in my head. Additionally, working with someone else challenged me to be a more precise and careful coder, so that we wouldn't get caught up fixing my errors in the code and fall behind in the activity.
